This is a collection of wminput python plugins that allow using a Wiimote
as an event, mouse, and joystick driver.

race.py:
Used for a racing game I wrote.
There are six built in "commands" that can map to buttons, which are placed
in a config file. The config line looks like "Plugin.race.brake     = KEY_S".

brake, accel, acc_right, acc_left, left, right

The script prints each command as it's executed, so running wminput on the command
line will display which command it's sending.


shake.py:
This script adds a single new command that maps to any key: Plugin.shake.Shake
If the wiimote is shaken harder than "SHAKE_THRESHOLD" (run the plugin to test
the sensitivity), it will simulate the button press (I used it for KEY_NEXTSONG).

Since the Wiimote sends data constantly, after the button press is sent the
action is "disabled" for RELEASE_DELAY time to allow for the user to stop shaking
the Wiimote.
